# Weather app

## Description
This is a responsive and feature-rich Weather application built with React and TypeScript. Developed as a portfolio project, it allows users to search for cities by name or geographic coordinates and view detailed weather forecasts. The application displays hourly forecasts (from 0:00 to 23:00) and a 7-day forecast for the selected location. Users can also create a list of favorite cities to quickly check their current weather conditions. A dark mode is included for an enhanced user experience. The main focus of this project is working with external APIs, including fetching, handling, and displaying real-time weather data in a structured and user-friendly manner.
